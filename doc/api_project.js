If you can't remember how to do this, revisit <a href=\"https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects\">https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects</a>.</li>\n<li>Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:</li>\n<li><strong>User Story:</strong> I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).</li>\n<li><strong>User Story:</strong> If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.</li>\n<li><strong>User Story:</strong> If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.</li>\n<li>Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the &quot;I've completed this challenge&quot; button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.</li>\n<li>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information, refer to <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice\">https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice</a>.</p>\n"
